            <h4>Small Bug Fixes!</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Well, Season 1 worked out a lot of kinks. It ultimately left us with an extreme understanding of what we desire to do. </li>
                <li>In this season there will likely be more anonymity among your host and you. Rather than your host reaching out to you personally, you will be recieving cards, (just like the one that directed you here) that explain your instructions.</li>
                <li>We now have an email! <a href= "mailto: grantgame0@gmail.com"> grantgame0@gmail.com </a> ! if you have any questions regaurding these cards, or your tasks, please direct them there, and a sales associate will respond quickly!</li>
                <li>We now require every Grant to have a team member living with them! This gives you a roommate, and gives us free footage of our participants!</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Big Changes!</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>With over 50 new members, this is Grant Games biggest season yet.</li>
                <li>You will be invited to locations via the cards found in your mail. If you can not make the predetermined time, we ask that you email the official email with your request to change the date. The council will decide.</li>
                <li>We are now doing "Drops". These are themed sets of random items. You will be told the theme when you arrive at the scene to collect your items.</li>
                <li>When you arrive at your scene, an associate will be hidden to record you collecting the items. We ask that you also record yourself collecting the "drop"</li>
